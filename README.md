# WTF, Java 9?! :scream:

Some things break on Java 9.
In this repository I collect [short, self contained, correct (or not) examples](http://www.sscce.org/) demonstrating what fails and (hopefully) how to fix it.
Note that there is no judgment involved!
This is not about whether the things _should_ break or not and whether that's good or bad - it's just about what _does_ break.

Most topics or problems get their own subdirectory to make sure they don't interfere with one another.
