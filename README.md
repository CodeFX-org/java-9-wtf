# WTF, Java 9?! :scream:

Some things break on Java 9.
In this repository I collect [short, self contained, correct (or not) examples](http://www.sscce.org/) demonstrating what breaks and (hopefully) how to fix it.
Each topic or problem gets its own subdirectory to make sure they don't interfere with one another.

Contributions are very welcome!
